# WeatherMap Application Frontend
This Vue.js frontend application provides an intuitive interface for accessing and analyzing air pollution data from a Spring Boot backend. It leverages data retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap public API, allowing users to query and visualize air quality trends over time.
## Application Setup
Install yarn and tailwind
```sh
yarn install
```

```sh
yarn add tailwindcss
```

```sh
npx tailwindcss init
```

## Run
```sh
yarn dev
```

## API Integration
The frontend communicates with a Spring Boot backend that provides air pollution data via various endpoints. Ensure your backend is running and accessible for the frontend to function correctly.
